<p>In this python project, my partners and I developed a code where it would run a quiz. We wrote a while loop that would continue the quiz as long as the person would get the answer the question correctly. We also wrote a random function that would randomize the order of the questions on the quiz. There were some difficulties that my partners and I faced when making this code, such as a group problem about the code not stop looping and an independent problem about the questions would repeat themselves after answering them. The 1st issue was solved collaboratively by setting a state function to use for our code, along with the 2nd issue being solved independently making another state system along with an if else statement for the question to not repeat after answering a question. In this project I came up with the questions, created the answers, along with setting the inputs values. This development was worked on collaboratively with my partners, Logan and Christain Z.</p>
